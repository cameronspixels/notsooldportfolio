        <h3>The Industry</h3>
        <p>If there’s one thing that I was always fairly certain of, it’s that I would’ve likely ended up working in the digital space. I didn’t always know where or how I’d get there, but ask anyone who knew me throughout, and you’d be told that it was inevitable. It was consistently obvious to me that digital was growing at a crazy rate, even though I had no indicator as to the actual scale. Looking at the <a href="https://technation.techcityuk.com/" title="TechNation report online">TechNation report</a> and the figures now, and <a href="https://technation.techcityuk.com/pm-foreward/" title="Theresa May TechNation foreword">even Theresa May's on board</a>!</p>
        <p>My technical skills were always an asset to me. Asking when I was 14 or 15, and I would’ve told you that I wanted to be a game developer. Minecraft — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/16/minecraft-game-no-rules-changed-gaming" title="">the industry-defining indie game developed by Mojang</a> — was on the up and presented this great, developer-friendly sandbox environment. I couldn’t imagine building something like that from the ground up, but being so open, it was a great platform to learn through modding.</p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Early Minecraft actually taught me a lot. I learnt to mod in Java, which I and a couple of friends would turn into playing around with making (very) basic stick figure platforming games. I learnt basic PHP, how FTP and hosting worked, and how to utilise the command line to run my own public multiplayer sever, which I went on to build a community around. I was then given a lesson in leadership through running that server, which was one of the first meaningful, non-technical lessons.</p>
        <p>It’s strange to think what could’ve been. I remember well creating an early modding tutorial for Minecraft on YouTube, which at the that of deleting it, had surpassed 120,000 views. Looking at the way that that specific media’s grown, 15 year old me could quite possibly have been on to something. If I’ve learnt one important thing from it all, especially when it comes to ever growing platforms, it’s being part of something niche and ‘weird’ is more often a blessing than a curse, and brings opportunity… if you use it right. <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/285858" title="">Take that from the best, I guess</a>.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>I wanted to be more creative, and lost the heart for programming along the way. Once more, if I look back on that, it was a shame. I went to college studying IT and chose a graphics &amp; media route, as opposed to a programming one. We dabbled in C for a bit, and though I found it fairly easy to pick up having understood the fundamentals of Java (even if I’d forgotten exactly how to write it at this point), I longed for something a little more fulfilling.</p>
        <p>The indecision there meant that I didn’t consider university too much, or even understand entirely how it worked. I found a Digital Media/Marketing course browsing through UCAS one day, and though I still can’t put my finger on why, decided that it would be the only choice. With offers from all universities that I applied to, I chose MMU.</p>
        <p>Perhaps inevitable given the impulse in the decision, I didn’t really ever feel it for marketing. I reasonably well in it, given the lack of real interest. I was part of groups that made this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBbVDU4mq30" title="Swizzels' Love Hearts video">advertisement for Swizzels’ Love Hearts brand</a>, and created this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByvNqwTNzDddcjI2N255TFhrMFE/view?usp=sharing" title="PDF of Flux Fitness portfolio">theoretical brand extension for Sony Playstation</a> (be warned, though it does NOT download automatically, that links to a big .PDF file). We managed solid firsts for both of those through extensive research and well thought presentation.</p>

        <h3>Building the Site</h3>
        <p>As I’d imagine most students might go, previous iterations of my portfolio send shudders down my spine. I felt that poor design and development decisions couldn’t just be a lack of knowledge though, and a lot of people in industry put empathises on planning - and you could include in that wireframing, prototyping, sticking post-it notes everywhere. It’s most of the time the case that, if you’re to put a student website amongst a number of (even junior) professional’s, it’ll stick out like a sore thumb. While I’d argue that my latest effort wasn’t <i>so</i> bad, there were still a lot of things that I’d look at and not think twice about discarding.</p>
        <p>As such, I went researching. As much as I could look at a professional portfolio and know that it’s a step up, I didn’t know why. As well as taking a look at some past MMU graduate’s sites while they were still linked to, I Googled for some good examples of portfolios in my sort of area - returning some good examples like <a href="" title="">Ian Lunn</a>, <a href="" title="">Matt Farley</a> and <a href="" title="">Emily Ridge</a>. These were the ones that I thought were the <i>best</i> examples at least, with aspects and elements which I deemed attainable.</p>
        <p>My research returned staples like big buttons position front and center, serving as call-to-actions, and a natural progression through the site (often through links at the end of pages). Icons were also a big thing - visual indicators accompanying text, as opposed to just text alone; I was beginning to see that everywhere.</p>
        <p>A theme that I saw occasionally and despised was almost anything that hides content, or presents an extra step in order to access it. I’ve no affinity whatsoever towards a carousel of images, and hamburger menus on desktop are a long time pet hate. <a href="">Rafael Caferati’s</a> portfolio, whilst stunning technically, made me give up after clicking right on the carousel just once.</p>
