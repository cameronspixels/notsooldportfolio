        <h3>Building the Site</h3>
        <p>As I’d imagine most students might go, previous iterations of my portfolio send shudders down my spine. I felt that poor design and development decisions couldn’t just be a lack of knowledge though, and a lot of people in industry put empathises on planning - and you could include in that wireframing, prototyping, sticking post-it notes everywhere. It’s most of the time the case that, if you’re to put a student website amongst a number of (even junior) professionals', it’ll stick out like a sore thumb. While I’d argue that my latest effort wasn’t <i>so</i> bad, there were still a lot of things that I’d look at and not think twice about discarding.</p>
        <p>As such, I went researching. As much as I could look at a professional portfolio and know that it’s a step up, I didn’t know why. As well as taking a look at some past MMU graduate’s sites while they were still linked to, I Googled for some good examples of portfolios in my sort of area - returning some good ones like <a href="https://ianlunn.co.uk/" title="Ian Lunn's web portfolio">Ian Lunn</a>, <a href="http://mattfarley.ca/" title="Matt Farley's web portfolio">Matt Farley</a> and <a href="http://www.emilyridge.ie/" title="Emily Ridge's web portfolio">Emily Ridge</a>. These were the ones that I thought were the <i>best</i> examples at least, with aspects and elements which I deemed attainable to my level.</p>

            <p>My initial wireframe designs for mobile.</p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>My research returned staples like big buttons position front and center, serving as call-to-actions, and a natural progression through the site (often through links at the end of pages). Icons were also a big thing - visual indicators accompanying text, as opposed to just text alone; I was beginning to see that everywhere. The Nielsen Norman Group wrote an <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/" title="NN Group artcile on icons">article on icons on the web</a>, which highlights why I really love seeing them - they're (in most cases) universally recognisable, easy targets that immediately resonate with the user - as opposed to plain text, where the context isn't always there straight away.</p>

          <img src="img/icons.jpg" alt="Icons used on the web">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>A theme that I saw occasionally and despised was almost anything that hides content or presents an extra step in order to access it. I’ve no affinity whatsoever towards a carousel of images, and hamburger menus on desktop are a long time pet hate. Hidden navigation (and other content) is useful where you can’t appropriately fit content into a viewport - but where you can, and you make the choice to still hide content, it’s even <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/" title="NN Group article on menu usability">proven to be much less effective</a>. <a href="https://caferati.me/" title="Rafael Caferati's web portfolio">Rafael Caferati’s portfolio</a>, whilst stunning technically, made me give up after clicking right on the carousel just once.</p>
        <p>While building the portfolio, one of the technologies that I came across which I’m yet to use is CSS Grids. Hearing that it’s the next best thing, I took to reading into it.  I first came across a CSS Tricks article detailing <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" title="CSS Tricks article on grid">everything that you’d need to start with grid</a>, and following reference from that article, I also picked up a copy of Rachael Andrews’ <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/get-ready-for-css-grid-layout" title="Rachael Andrews' Get Ready for CSS Grid Layout">‘Get Ready for CSS Grid Layout’</a>. It's considered one of the best ways to go about layout in the future, once compatibility is across the board <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid" title="CSS Grids compatibility">(it's almost there!)</a>. Grids remove the need for hacked together methods of positioning elements, which were never made for positioning entire pages in the first place (the likes of floats and to a degree, even positioning like absolute) and present a method that's much easier to control from a CSS point of view.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="img/cssgrids.jpg" alt="CSS Grids compatibility">
          <figcaption>
            <p>CSS Grids are almost compatible across the board, as shown by <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid" title="CSS grids compatibility">caniuse.com</a></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>After implementing it on a short scale though, I came to realise that grid lacked use in the layout that I was using - one that’s very much single column, where content flows naturally without almost any CSS anyway. It still use it in the header - it works well to keep the arrow to the bottom of the viewport, and the nav spanning the width on mobile - but I was hesitant to use it throughout. I’m certainly keen on using it to a greater extent going forward. Something that I feel would be a huge benefit to myself is that it would allow me to experiment with design a lot more with positioning being so easy by default, and I could break out of keeping things very linear.</p>
        <p>I’d finally touch on accessibility. Attending Wordcamp Manchester 2017, I was at a talk by specialist <a href="http://www.twitter.com/coolfields/" title="Graham Armfield's Twitter page">Graham Armfield</a>, who noted the ignorance in some modern browsers towards accessibility issues. You could often be tabbing through a page and visually have no idea where you were. Things like that put accessibility in greater context.</p>
        <p>As such, I’ve taken precautions like altering the default browser focus to include yellow backgrounds on links and yellow outlines on forms - <a href="http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/form-elements/" title=".GOV.UK sugesstions on styling form elements">as recommended by .GOV.UK</a>. They also suggest removing presets from form fields, and instead hinting above what you’d like the user to fill in, just so that they don’t lose the suggestion when they begin typing.</p>
